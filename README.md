> We introduce SeqAfford, a Multi-Modal Language Model (MLLM) capable of serialized affordance inference implied in human instructions: 1) Single Affordance Reasoning; 2) Sequential Affordance Reasoning; 3) Sequential Affordance Reasoning with Multiple Objects

## I have quit the graduate program @ShanghaiTech Unversity in March 2024 while I am the co-first author, and therefore do not have the final version of the code. The code in this repository is my preliminary code from around September 2024, with some details potentially missing. However, to help the community follow up on our research, I have uploaded it here. But I noticed that the VDI group member@ShanghaiTech [Zhenhao Zhang](https://zhangzhh.cn/) have utilized this model to help with HOI generation, so you can check the details in his repo [OpenHOI](https://github.com/Zhenhao-Zhang/OpenHOI), which was accepted by NeurIPS 2025 as an oral paper.

## 📣 News

- [2/27/2025] 🎉🎉🎉SeqAfford has been accepted by CVPR 2025!!!🎉🎉🎉
- [12/2/2024] SeqAfford has been released on Arxiv now!!!

## 😲 Results
Please refer to our [homepage](https://seq-afford.github.io) for more thrilling results!


## 🛠️ Setup
- 1. Create a new `conda` environment and activate it by following command
  ```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yaml
  ```
- 2. Down [ShapeLLM](https://github.com/qizekun/ShapeLLM/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md) model weight into your directory, and Modify the model path in the `scripts/finetune_lora.sh`， including both `--vision_tower_path` and `--pretrain_mm_mlp_adapter`
 
 - 3. Down [Uni3D](https://github.com/baaivision/Uni3D) model weight into your directory, and Modify the model path in the `./llava/model/language_model/affordancellm.py`
 
- 4. you can train your own model by running the following code
 
```bash
  sh ./scripts/finetune_lora.sh
```
